#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       


to-do: 
1. my likes interface
2. my collection interface
3. add/remove tags
4. comment system
5. beautify the app
6. search according to tags
7. make the interface suit every version of ios or android phone
8. scroll down/up to refresh/load

We keep track of what needs to get done by considering our time, people available, and what we can do. For example, due to technology issue, we do not decide to implement recommendation system. We also keep track by whether the existing feature is well-functional, if it has bugs, we need to spend time to solve it, but we might give up or modify what we are about to do. 
We prioritize our tasks by how basic the task is. We tend to make the basic tasks done well before implement the tasks based on them. Since if we cannot done the basic tasks, there is no reason that we do any further. For example, we put our beautification tasks to the end since we have to make sure our basic function is working well. We work on the comment system and myLikes/Collection interface first since they are the necessary feature for a social media app.
We assign tasks to every team member based on what job he/she did on the deliverable 2. Due to we lost one team member, and she did the front end job, her work may fall on other team member that writes the front end codes. We also assign tasks to team members based on their ability. Since we use Javascript to write our app, and not all team members are familiar to it, we assign easier jobs for team member who is not strong in coding, and let him to complete markdown and test jobs.



#### Git / GitHub workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     


Initially, we have every team member fork the project into their repository. Usually, every team member works on a .js file, so we can push the changes and make pull request from the personal repo to master branch easily. When we need to connect front end interface to back end, we often have team member who writes back end to do so. Since we often write code session together, we can communicate fluently, and we seldom meet situation where we need to review the pull-requests and have someone to merge them. Almost all the pull-requests can be merged automatically. We choose this kind of workflow to avoid unnecessary conflicts in works that people so. If team members modify the file they want, then there will be a lot pull requests that need to be negotiated, which will slow down our speed.


## Product

#### Goals and tasks


1. my likes interface
2. my collection interface
3. add/remove tags
4. comment system
5. beautify the app
6. search according to tags
7. make the interface suit every version of ios or android phone
8. scroll down/up to refresh/load

We aim at creating an app that is easy for users to use and has most function that a popular social media app has. For an app that recommends users of their dressing style and users can share their dressing style to others, the likes and collection function is important, also, there is a must that we support searching and category.
