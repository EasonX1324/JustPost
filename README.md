# Just Post (Based on ReactNative & Expo & Firebase)
This is the product made by team 18. This is a software for users to view clothes and leave feedbacks or comments and buy clothes. Nowadays, users are usually buying clothes on buyer websites but, for those buyer websites, users cannot share the feedback and comments to each other. There is no way for users to evaluate how good their wanted clothes are. Just Post is a way that can help all users to share the shopping experience to each other. In this mile stone, we are only focusing on sharing experience of shopping clothes. In the future mile stone, there might be a place where all users can share any activities of shopping, making-ups, traveling etc.
