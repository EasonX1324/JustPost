# Team 18: Just Post
## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 14th
 * Where: BA2210

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.
1. The most successful one is that we came up with the idea of this application. Since it can solve real life dressing problems for all kinds of users. 
2. We have useful features like tag system to help users find what they want easily, and counter system along with rating and comment system to help users get most useful product they want.
3. If our process goes smoothly, we can even add features that help people at all aspects in daily lives and not only restrict to solving dressing problems. And the application can be a platform where all kinds of people share their ideas with others to solve real life problems.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
1. We wanted to make the application be able to automatically change its theme color according to the color of their phone case. It is not as well as we hoped since we have no idea of how it can be implemented and it is not relevant with the application.
2. We planned to make a friend list UI to make the application a more socialized one, but it turns out that it deviates the core capacity of our application and it is complicated to implement, we are not sure that we can do it properly.


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * None


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * The UI design is proposed, and it shows our basic structure and features that need to be implemented in the future.
 * The flow of how the pages of the application would interact with users is configured. For example, the post page would be opened if the user taps on the preview of the post on the homepage.


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

1. At the beginning, we were considering to add an e-commerce feature which indicates that users can buy the clothes they are interested in from the posts in the application directly. It was not completed because we may use more databases and security algorithms for this feature which is complicated for us to implement. 
2. Furthermore, we had an idea that used the technology of face recognition to help users in dressing. For example, for users who are interested in the clothing posted, the application  can let them “try” it on. It was not met since we are not so familiar with machine learning and it may cost us too much time to learn by ourselves.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* We will construct the basic structure of the project, and set up the frontend, backend and database as we proposed in the former meetings.
* It is important to configure and construct the basic logics of the application. For example, how many data types required and how they work in the database.
