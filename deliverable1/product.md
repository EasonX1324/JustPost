#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

Nowadays many people have a lot of idea on their mind that wants to be shared, also there is a lot of people are in trouble with something in their life like what kind of cloth is fashion this season or are their any recommendation for making up that can make you outstanding. That’s what we want to solve!  
We are planning to build a ios mobile app that everyone can post their idea for anything here with picture and comments, everyone can write review for it and also like it. 


 


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Our product is for all kinds of users. For instance, students, employees, etc. Any one can post their idea for things in life there. Any one can browse those interesting posts on our app. To be specific if you are a student you can post any study tips, or you can share your dressing tips. If you are housewife you can post some tips that make our life easier and so on. Anyone can write down their reviews as well. 


 

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Obviously, if everyone can post their idea on our app, for example if a girl wants to date a boy, and she wants to dress up nice but she don’t know what to choose, then our app should be the saver. She can just search “dressing for date”, there will be a lot of posts to solve this problem, and she can choose her favorite one. This shows that no matter if you are a student or in any position, you can share your idea or search for help for every different type of problem in real life.




### Highlights


At first, we plan to make a social application that can let people share many things on it. However, we realize that the range is too wide. Therefore we then focus on sharing clothes because it can give some advices about dressing and we believe it will help our users a lot.

Then we decide to give some recommendations to users. Every cloth sharing will have a like button, we will recommend these sharing to users which have the most likes. There clothes are most popular that most people like it. Hence we believe those recommendations can save users' time and help them to find their favorite clothes.

We also decide to add tags for different cloth sharing which can help us to classify different clothes. For example, some users may want to find a cloth in formal occasions, then he can find it by searching "formal" tag. Some user may want to find a cloth in tropical, then he can search by "short" or "beach" tags.
