## Iteration 01

 * Start date: October 2
 * End date: October 9

## Process


We met with group members and discussed how our software help people in their real life.

#### Roles & responsibilities

TBA



#### Events

The first meeting was held October 6th in BA2210. We were holding this meeting In-person. The first meeting is about making decision and we were still trying to figure out what we should make for this project.Later on, for the purpose of each meeting, it will include code reviews and weekly meeting about the project. Besides, code sessions will be held possibly each week depending on whether or not group members need help. Also, when group members are struggling with some parts of the project, they could chat questions through online group chat application like IMessage, facebook, WeChat etc.


#### Artifacts

The artifact we will produce is a todo-list table which will be on the google doc. Members will look at the table to keep track of the work. When the group members are finished, they will put a check mark beside that Task. We have priority class for each Task and the highest priority Task will be kept track of every single day online. We have a column for group members and this is for assigning work for team members.


## Product


#### Goals and tasks

1. Clarify the functions our product will have by thinking of some user stories and discussing them during the first meeting.
